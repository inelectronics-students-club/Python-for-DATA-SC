        "# Introduction to NumPy\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy is one of the two most important libraries in Python for data science, along with Pandas. NumPy is a crucial library for effectively loading, storing, and manipulating in-memory data in Python, all of which will be at the heart of what you do with data science in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Datasets come from a huge range of sources and in a wide range of formats, such as text documents, images, sound clips, numerical measurements, and nearly anything else. Despite this variety, however, the start of data science is to think of all data fundamentally as arrays of numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, the words in documents can be represented as the numbers that encode letters in computers or even the frequency of particular words in a collection of documents. Digital images can be thought of as two-dimensional arrays of numbers representing pixel brightness or color. Sound files can be represented as one-dimensional arrays of frequency versus time. However, no matter what form our data takes, in order to analyze it, our first step will be to transform it into arrays of numbers—which is where NumPy comes in (and pandas down the road).\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy is short for *Numerical Python*, and it provides an efficient means of storing and operating on dense data buffers in Python. Array-oriented computing in Python goes back to 1995 with the Numeric library. Scientific programming in Python took off over the next 10 years, but the collections of libraries splintered. The NumPy project began in 2005 as a means of bringing the Numeric and NumArray projects together around a single array-based framework.\n",

Each item in a list is really a separate Python object (the list is an object itself, true, but mostly it is an object that serves as a container for the memory pointers to the constituent objects). That means that each item in a list must contain its own type info, reference count, and other information. All of this information can become expensive in terms of memory and performance if we are dealing with hundreds of thousands or millions of items in a list. Moreover, for many uses in data science, our arrays just store a single type of data (such as integers or floats), which means that all of the object-related information for items in such an array would be redundant.

With Python lists, slices are only shallow copies of lists; if you modify a copy, it doesn't affect the parent list. When you modify a NumPy subarray, you modify the original list. Be careful: this can have ramifications when you are trying to just work with a small part of a large dataset and you don’t want to change the whole thing. Let's look more closely."

        "To briefly interpret the code snippet above, we passed two parameters to the bar function in pyplot: the first defining the index for the x-axis and the second defining the data to use for the bars (the y-axis). To create the index, we use the NumPy function `arange` to create a sequence of numbers (this is the same `arange` we encountered earlier in this section). We know that the length of our array is 12, but it can be a good habit to get into to programmatically pass the length of an array in case it changes or you don’t know it with specificity. We also added 1 to both the start and the end of the `arange` to accommodate for Python zero-indexing (because there is no “month-zero” in the calendar).\n",

There are still several questions we would like to answer, such as in how many months did it rain, or what was the average precipitation in those months? We would use masking to answer those questions. (We will also return to this example dataset to demonstrate concepts throughout the rest of this section.) Before we dive deeper in explaining what masking is, we should briefly touch on comparison operators in NumPy."
