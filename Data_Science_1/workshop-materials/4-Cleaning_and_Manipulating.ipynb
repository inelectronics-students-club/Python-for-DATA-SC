        "Before we get to the colorful world of graphing our data, we have to contend with the fact that real world data is messy. You will likely need to combine several data sources to get the data you want. The data from those sources will be incomplete. It will not likely be formatted in exactly the way you want to perform your analysis. It's for these reasons that most data scientists believe that about 80 percent of any project is spent getting the data into a form ready for analysis. Our graphs will only make sense after combing through our data and cleaning up the sore spots.\n",
