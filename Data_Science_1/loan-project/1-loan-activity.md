## Logistical Regression - Loan Qualification Predictor

Contoso Data FinCo helps customers qualify for home loans. They are a global data science company that works in all sectors of housing.  Customers first apply for a home loan after Contoso Data validates the customer eligibility for a loan.

In this project, Contoso Data wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer details provided while filling out an online application form. These details are:

* Gender,
* Marital Status,
* Education,
* Income, Loan Amount,
* Credit History and others.

To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customer’s segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. You will be provided with Training and Testing Data.
